                                 The country of Georgia is now considered the birthplace of wine as recently
                                 unearthed wine making artifacts are more than 8,000 years old — these are
                                 the oldest wine making remains in the world! And culturally speaking, specific
                                 regions within Georgia such as Kakheti, Kartli, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi,
                                 Svaneti and Abkhazia are famous wine making places; legends and recorded
                                 history document centuries of continual wine making. Vessels discovered in the
                                 Anaklia region have proven Georgians were making wine in the Neolithic era
                                 in a manner that would be familiar even today. .

                                 Vino culture has been connected with the spread of Christianity in Georgia
                                 as well: St. Nino tied vine branches with her own hair to show the cross and
                                 preach Christianity to Georgians in the fourth century — to this day the top bar
                                 of the Georgian cross is slightly bent as a wine branch was the first time
                                 Georgian’s witnessed the cross. There are about 450 unique vine varieties in
                                 Georgia and most of these would not be familiar to western palettes.
                                 Unfortunately, during the Soviet period when winemakers focused on massive
                                 production, some rare varieties that needed special care were abandoned and
                                 are now mostly extinct.

                                 After the fall of communism in Georgia, many winemakers in the country started a retrospective of wine grapes and wine
                                 making techniques that had made Georgia so unique in the winemaking world to begin with.
                                 In 2013, a couple of maverick Georgian winemakers such as Baia Abuladze and her sister Gvantsa started to rediscover
                                 the rarest species of wine grapes in Western Georgia and to focus on bio wine making techniques. The re-discovery process
                                 continues until today: Baia Abuladze, together with her winemaking family, stands among those Georgian winemakers
                                 who work to identify and classify local vine varieties
