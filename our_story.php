                                 The country of Georgia is now considered the birthplace of wine as recently
                                 unearthed wine making artifacts are more than 8,000 years old — these are
                                 the oldest wine making remains in the world! And culturally speaking, specific
                                 regions within Georgia such as Kakheti, Kartli, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi,
                                 Svaneti and Abkhazia are famous wine making places; legends and recorded
                                 history document centuries of continual wine making. Vessels discovered in the
                                 Anaklia region have proven Georgians were making wine in the Neolithic era
                                 in a manner that would be familiar even today.`

                                 Vino culture has been connected with the spread of Christianity in Georgia
                                 as well: St. Nino tied vine branches with her own hair to show the cross and
                                 preach Christianity to Georgians in the fourth century — to this day the top bar
                                 of the Georgian cross is slightly bent as a wine branch was the first time
                                 Georgian’s witnessed the cross. There are about 450 unique vine varieties in
                                 Georgia and most of these would not be familiar to western palettes.
                                 Unfortunately, during the Soviet period when winemakers focused on massive
                                 production, some rare varieties that needed special care were abandoned and
                                 are now mostly extinct.

                                 After the fall of communism in Georgia, many winemakers in the country started a retrospective of wine grapes and wine
                                 making techniques that had made Georgia so unique in the winemaking world to begin with.
                                 In 2013, a couple of maverick Georgian winemakers such as Baia Abuladze and her sister Gvantsa started to rediscover
                                 the rarest species of wine grapes in Western Georgia and to focus on bio wine making techniques. The re-discovery process
                                 continues until today: Baia Abuladze, together with her winemaking family, stands among those Georgian winemakers
                                 who work to identify and classify local vine varieties.

                              Baia and her younger siblings — Gvantsa (Sister) and Giorgi (Brother) were born and raised in Obcha in a friendly, traditional
                              family of winemakers. They spent a happy childhood watching how parents and grandparents were involved in the diverse
                              winemaking processes. Children were also allowed to arrange their own small farm with vineyards, greens, household animals
                              and plantations, and spent their free time exploring the wonders of nature. At that time, the Abuladze family traditionally
                              produced wine using Imeretian technology — the maceration process (soaking the juice of the grape with the skins and
                              sometimes also the stems) was shorter and only 5-10% of grape skin was used during fermentation in Qvevri.

                              In 2015, the Abuladze’s family business participated in the local agricultural startup competition and won the grant of
                              GEL 5000 (about $2,000 USD at the time) to buy a used wine bottling machine to increase production and quality. At the
                              same time, Baia officially established the new wine company and the label Baia’s Wine was born. Accompanied by her younger
                              siblings, she totally remodelled the production structure and focused on the organic winemaking techniques. The family’s
                              attitude towards each step of winemaking changed: the maceration process increased up to 3 months, each Qvevri was treated
                              individually — more time was aligned for degustation to decide whether the liquid is ready for the further treatment; and the
                              decision about what percent of the grape skin is used during fermentation and aging was given priority.

                              one of the first organic wine producers in Bagdati Municipality.

                              Despite the family’s winemaking experience, the first
                              steps for Baia and her siblings were not easy: Baia’s
                              passion was to create a sustainable vineyard and to
                              learn everything possible about a wine making process
                              that reflected nature’s own process. Within that mission,
                              her younger sister Gvantsa travelled to Mosel, Germany,
                              as an intern to one of the best biodynamic wineries to
                              obtain knowledge and a deep dive into the magic
                              process of making organic wine

                              The grant that Baia won allowed for the family to bottle
                              a higher standard wine, but she could not afford to buy
                              a car to deliver those first bottles to Tbilisi. With her
                              siblings’ help, she was able to carry them by train and
                              deliver to each distribution channel by Tbilisi public
                              transport. Amazingly, those bottles turned into a massive
                              success: restaurants and wine bars ordered more bottles immediately and customers gave great feedback. Soon afterwards,
                              the family business became part of the Georgian Farmers’ Association, which, in its turn, brought publicity in popular TV shows,

                              Publicity and fame brought up another challenge: restaurants ordered more quantities while the young entrepreneurs found it
                              quite hard to manage large-scale production from bottling to delivery in a timely manner. In parallel with running business,
                              all of them had their university studies ongoing and parents were not familiar with Tbilisi streets to deliver the bottles
                              to the partners’ establishments. The young trio accelerated their production by organizing equipment: they gathered and
                              washed the old family pitchers that had been long forgotten and were able to harvest enough grapes for about 8,000 bottles.
                              Business continued to grow. As the younger generation of the winemakers were more focused on innovative organic techniques,
                              the siblings decided they needed to expand their knowledge again in the agricultural field. Giorgi decided to study enology and
                              Gvantsa was enrolled in the master of agronomy at Georgian Agricultural University

                              A few years after starting with white wines, the trio offered red wine from Otskhanusi Sapere and Aladasturi grapes. Today,
                              they produce wines from Imeretian vine varieties such as Tsolikouri, Tsitska, Krakhuna, Aladasturi, Otskhanuri Sapere.

                              is all done by the trio in the family cellar, to proudly offer the highest-quality organic Georgian wine to the world

                              The village Obcha boasts a unique microclimate for
                              growing grapes. The location is unique — sitting in the
                              eastern part of the Sairme Mountains which gives a slightly
                              higher angle for the rays of the sun and a greater solar
                              intensity. At 324 meters of altitude, the land offers an ideal
                              location for growing premium wine grapes:
                              The well-balanced geography, micro-climate and
                              well-drained soil come together to create the perfect
                              environment for Bais’s exquisitely handcrafted wines.
                              The heavy cold air collected between the high peaks
                              during the night drains off the heights, much like water,
                              joining cold moist air, creating a double cooling effect.
                              The cool nighttime temperatures are critical in developing
                              high quality grapes. The alluvial soil, with clay, gravel,
                              sand and limestone has another significant influence on
                              wine quality. The limestone offers good drainage in the wet
                              years, retaining much needed moisture in the dry vintages,
                              while adding various mineral elements to the soils, which
                              transfer to the gorgeous grapes.
